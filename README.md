This is the final, final, final version of my neovim configuration.

Why again:
    - Performance
    - Have C and Rust ffi (foreign function interface)
    - Some plugins now have better alternatives
    - Replace Obsidian with a neovim like equivalent
    - Start developing my own plugins
    - Know every single line of code in this repo
    - Add acutally working debugging
    - Keep Windows in mind
    - Keep NixOS in mind
    - Keep VS Code in mind
